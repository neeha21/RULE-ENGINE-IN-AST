To represent the AST, we can define a Node class with the following fields:

type: A string indicating the node type, either "operator" for AND/OR or "operand" for conditions.
left: A reference to another Node, representing the left child.
right: A reference to another Node, representing the right child for operators.
value: An optional value for operand nodes, such as a number for comparisons.
